    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    
    <p>Welcome to the introduction of my first year's college work.<br>
It has been a journey of learning to code in C/C++ and make simple games in SFML. It wasn't all just about coding, we learned how to use Photoshop
      and Asprite to make the art and animation for our games. In order to create understandable interfaces, we spent some time designing
      interfaces and apps in Figma as well as learning HTML and CSS basics.<br>
By the end of the school year we used acquired skills in a multiple projects. Here I am showing you, in chronological order, 
      some projects that I took part in. The progress from the time when we just started with SFML to the final team project which was not just about the ability
      to code but also the communication skills and to work in a team. <br> </p>
