  <h1>Space rat</h1>
  <p>My second projet. Shooting game with 2 enemies and a simple menu. You are playing as a space rat that is trying to get
  to the cheese protected by a wall and guards. Look out for a cat! It kills you immediatly. You loose one life out of three if you intersect with a guard.
  </p>
  <p>There is instruction scree, option to choose your character, game play and end screen with an option to restart the game.</p>
  <p>I coded everything, drew graphics and animated it.</p>
